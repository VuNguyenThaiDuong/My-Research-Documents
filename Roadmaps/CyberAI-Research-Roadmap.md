# CyberAI Research Roadmap

This document outlines a research plan for applying AI in cybersecurity.

## Research Phases
- **Phase 1**: Survey existing AI-based security solutions and datasets.
- **Phase 2**: Develop novel algorithms for intrusion detection or anomaly detection.
- **Phase 3**: Publish findings in A/A* conferences or Q1 journals.

## Resources
- **Papers**: USENIX, IEEE Security & Privacy, ACM CCS.
- **Datasets**: NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15.
- **Tools**: TensorFlow, PyTorch for model development, Wireshark for network analysis.

## Milestones
- Prototype a CV-based intrusion detection system.
- Submit a paper to a top-tier security conference like USENIX.
- Develop a dataset for CyberAI research.
