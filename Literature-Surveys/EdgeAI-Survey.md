# Edge AI Survey

This document surveys Edge AI, focusing on deploying AI models on resource-constrained devices.

## Topics Covered
- **Model Optimization**: Quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation for edge deployment.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Use of TPUs, NPUs, and edge GPUs.
- **Applications**: IoT, autonomous vehicles, smart sensors, and wearables.

## Key References
- Papers from NeurIPS, CVPR, and IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.
- Industry reports on edge computing trends (e.g., Gartner, IDC).
- Case studies on Edge AI in smart cities.

## Research Gaps
- Scalability of Edge AI in ultra-low-power environments.
- Real-time inference under strict latency constraints.
- Security of edge-deployed models against adversarial attacks.

## Example Tasks
- Reviewing recent Edge AI papers for updates.
- Proposing experiments to address identified research gaps.
