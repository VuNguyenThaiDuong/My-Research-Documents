# Computer Vision in Security

This document surveys the application of computer vision in cybersecurity.

## Topics Covered
- **Video Surveillance**: Object detection and anomaly detection in security footage.
- **Facial Recognition**: Authentication and identification for access control.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Real-time monitoring using CNNs and vision transformers.

## Key References
- Papers from CVPR, ICCV, and IEEE Security & Privacy.
- Datasets: i-LIDS, UCSD Anomaly Detection.
- Case studies on AI-driven security systems in airports.

## Research Gaps
- Robustness of CV models against adversarial attacks.
- Privacy-preserving techniques for facial recognition.
- Real-time processing in resource-constrained environments.

## Example Tasks
- Summarizing recent CVPR papers on security applications.
- Evaluating datasets for intrusion detection research.
